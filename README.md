# physkit-fortran

A modular computational physics toolkit written in modern Fortran.

## Description

physkit is a personal and academic project aimed at building a reusable computational physics toolkit throughout my academic formation as a physicist.

This repository is intended to grow progressively as new numerical methods, physical models, and computational techniques are learned and implemented.

## Objectives

## Project philosophy

Instead of writing independent programs for each assignment or simulation, physkit focuses on building a structured toolkit that evolves over time.

This project represents the transition from learning programming to developing scientific computing tools for physics.

## Status

Early development.

This project will expand continuously as part of my academic formation in physics and computational science.
