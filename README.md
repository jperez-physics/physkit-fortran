# physkit-fortran

A modular computational physics toolkit written in modern Fortran.

## Description

physkit is a personal and academic project aimed at building a reusable computational physics toolkit throughout my academic formation as a physicist.

This repository is intended to grow progressively as new numerical methods, physical models, and computational techniques are learned and implemented.

## Objectives

- Develop reusable scientific computing tools in Fortran
- Implement numerical methods used in physics
- Build simulation-ready modules for future academic work
- Transition from isolated scripts to structured scientific software

## Roadmap

The toolkit will include modules for:

- physical constants
- linear algebra
- numerical calculus
- ordinary differential equations
- partial differential equations
(This may change)

## Project philosophy

Instead of writing independent programs for each assignment or simulation, physkit focuses on building a structured toolkit that evolves over time.

This project represents the transition from learning programming to developing scientific computing tools for physics.

## Status

Early development.

This project will expand continuously as part of my academic formation in physics and computational science.
